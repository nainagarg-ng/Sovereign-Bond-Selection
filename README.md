## **PROECT SUMMARY**

### **DESCRIPTION**

This project provides a full bond trading research pipeline for sovereign bonds: it loads and cleans bond data from Excel, engineers a large set of features, builds multiple types of prediction targets, and prepares everything for model training and backtesting The project target audience are professional bond portfolio investors who would gain insight from gleaning over the nuanced measures and metrics presented. 


### **NOTEBOOKS & VISUALIZATIONS**

1. **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (Visualization I):** It highlights how the `capital value` invested across four sectors and six markets has varied over the years since the start of the new millenium and the corresponding returns produced.

2. **ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING (Visualization Ii):** It highlights how the `capital value` invested across four sectors and six markets has varied over the years since the start of the new millenium and the corresponding returns produced.

3. **AGENTIC AI MODEL PERFORMANCE (Visualization III):** It highlights the `income return`, `capital growth` and `total return` generated across the four sectors and six markets on an annualised as well as quarterly basis. (In the simplest terms, `Total Return` is the sum of `income return` and `capital growth`.)
   

### **RECOMMENDATION**

The project recommends Bond portfolio managers to diversify their assets across all the five countries and maturities. Through dynamic web visualizations, it highlights how various soveriegn bonds developed markets have performed during several economic troughs and peaks, and how optimization across diversified portfolio holdings have generated the most resilient returns and net growth. The analysis that these interactive visualizations facilitate make it clear that investing in one country (e.g., USA) or one maturity (e.g., 10-year) alone is not nearly as recession-resilient as diversifying investments across all the developed markets and maturities.
